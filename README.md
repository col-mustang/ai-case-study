# OpenAI Case Study

### _Then and Now_
  
  __OpenAI__ was founded in December of 2015 as a non-profit institution. Its stated goal was to "advance digital intelligence in a way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole."(Palihapitiya, 2023). Presently, OpenAI is an "AI research and deployment company" with a mission to "ensure that artificial general intellignece benefits all of humanity." (About, 2023) 

### _Who Created It and Why?_
  
  There were many founders involved in the creation of OpenAI. These members/entities included: Elon Musk, Sam Altman (present CEO), Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research. The idea for OpenAI emerged from the recognition that as AI technology advanced, it could have widespread implications for society, and there was a need to ensure that its development and deployment were aligned with human values and interests. The founders were motivated by the belief that access to, influence over, and benefits from AI should be widespread rather than concentrated in a few powerful entities. They aimed to create an organization that could conduct cutting-edge AI research and share the findings with the broader community.

### _Non-Profit or not Non-Profit?_

  OpenAI has received funding from various sources, including private investors, big tech partners (a subject of controversy), and from research grants. OpenAI has raised $14 billion over 9 rounds of funding from the stock market, $496 million of which came in the latest round of funding, at the end of April, 2023. On the flipside, OpenAI has generated $1.3 billion in revenue in 2023. (OpenAI, 2023)

### _What is (or Could be or Will be) the Problem?_
  
  OpenAI is focused on advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI) in a manner that benefits everyone. AGI refers to highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at nearly any economically viable work. The specific problems OpenAI aims to address can be broken down as follows:
  
  1. Beneficial Development of AGI: OpenAI is concerned with ensuring that the development of AGI is oriented toward positive outcomes for humanity. The organization strives to avoid uses of AI or AGI that could harm humanity or unduly concentrate power in the hands of a few.
  
  2. Safety and Ethics: OpenAI is committed to conducting research to make AGI safe and encouraging the broader AI community to adopt safety measures. This involves addressing potential risks and challenges associated with AGI, such as unintended consequences, ethical concerns, and the potential for malicious uses of powerful AI systems.
  
  3. Avoiding a Competitive Race Without Safety: OpenAI recognizes the risks of a competitive race to develop AGI without adequate safety precautions. To address this, the organization commits to stop competing with and start assisting any value-aligned, safety-conscious project that comes close to building AGI before they do.

  4. Technical Leadership: OpenAI aims to be at the forefront of AGI's capabilities to effectively address its impact on society. This involves conducting cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence to maintain technical leadership.

  5. Global Collaboration: OpenAI emphasizes cooperation and actively collaborates with other research and policy institutions around the globe, to address the global challenges posed by AGI.

  In summary, OpenAI is focused on addressing the challenges associated with the development and deployment of AGI to ensure its safe and beneficial use for humanity. The organization aims to lead in AI research, prioritize safety, and foster a collaborative approach to tackle the broader societal implications of AGI.

### _Is OpenAI __Really__ for Everyone?_

  OpenAI doesn't have commercial customers in the conventional sense. Its products and research are intended for everyone, mostly free of charge. The outputs of OpenAI's research, in [publications](https://openai.com/research), models ([GPT-3](https://openai.com/chatgpt) for example), and [insights](https://openai.com/safety), are often shared with the broader research community, policymakers, and the public. The goal is to contribute to the responsible and ethical development of AI and AGI, addressing concerns related to safety, ethics, and the equitable distribution of benefits.

  OpenAI's cooperative orientation, as outlined in its [Charter](https://openai.com/charter), reflects a commitment to working collaboratively with other research and policy institutions. By sharing knowledge globally, OpenAI aims to address the challenges associated with AGI and ensure that its development aligns with human values and interests.
  
  Other organizations may share some of the same principles as OpenAI. However, OpenAI's distinctiveness lies in its explicit commitment to a cooperative approach, safety, and a focus on the broad potential benefits of AGI for humanity.

### _Big Tech Influence_
  While this all sounds quite benevolent, OpenAI has recently been scrutinized for both its collaborations with its largest shareholder and a lack of transparency in its latest ChatGPT model release. 
  
  __Microsoft__ is the largest investor in OpenAI, having amassed an investment of $13 billion over the last four years (a roughly 49% stake). (O'Sullivan, 2023)(Bass, 2023) It's been subject to much debate as to whether their data collection practices are ethical and/or lawful. Mozilla even launched a [campaign](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/microsoft-ai/) claiming nine privacy experts were unable to understand how or if Microsoft captures and utilizes personal data unethically in training AI. 
  
  The release of GPT-4 was not as open as some would have preferred. The  originally realeased [report](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) failed to communicate "details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, the magnitude of its dataset, or the training method" dubbing it, "the most secretive release so far." (Ansari, 2023) A professor of Linguistics at the University of Washington tweeted that:
  > Keeping it so hush-hush has made it unfair to people who are now finding it difficult to know
  > whether their work has been scraped. Moreoever, it has become an impossible task to prove their
  > intellectual property and copyright in court - giving OpenAI a legal, yet unfair advantage.

### _GPTs & DALL-Es & Whispers, API!_
  OpenAI has been known for its work on various AI technologies, including natural language processing and generation. Notably, they have developed models such as the [GPT series](https://openai.com/chatgpt) (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), including models like GPT-4. These models are based on transformer architecture and have been at the forefront of large-scale language models, demonstrating capabilities in tasks such as language understanding, translation, and text generation.

  [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) (a surprising combination of Pixar's __WALL-E__ and the famous painter Salvador __Dali__), is a generative model developed by OpenAI that belongs to the GPT family. However, it is specifically designed to generate images from text descriptions. That's right, DALL-E is capable of understanding and translating text prompts to create photorealistic, abstract, or images representing many different styles or themes. With its capacity to generate unexpected outputs, DALL-E highlights the potential of large-scale generative models in the field of computer vision and innovative content creation.

  [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) is OpenAI's ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system, trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual data from the web. It features an enhanced robustness is understanding speech with accents, background noise, and technical language. It is also capable of transcription and translation of multiple languages into English. Like many of its products, OpenAI is open-sourcing the models and inference code, providing a foundation for useful applications and further research in robust speech processing.

  OpenAI's [API](https://openai.com/product) (Application Programming Interface) provides useful tools for [developers](https://openai.com/product#made-for-developers) in a simple interface.

## _Recommended Use_

Fresh off the heels of the latest Republican Primary Debate, the idea came to me that I think OpenAI could serve as a political education tool, primarily educating a given populace about local and regional legislation. My theory as to why much of the eligible voting populace doesn't vote is due to ingorance and indifference. Providing succinct summaries on what legislation actually communicates would be very beneficial in allowing people to understand what's going on and perhaps feel less overwhelmed. At the same time, this could serve to empower many to perform their civic duty of voting. This falls in line with OpenAI's universal betterment of humanity and society as a whole so fits their mission statement to some degree. A legislative education model/product would utilize the same NLP models currently in place, they would just be fine-tuned to legislation, that passed amongst the halls of Congress for instance, and tailored to explaining this legislation to your average citizen. Utilizing the complex language processing models that have already been developed makes sense to dissect and understand the overcomplicated jargon found in the documentation which codifiies our laws. Presenting this information simply in an app seems feasible.
